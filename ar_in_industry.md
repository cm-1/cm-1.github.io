Does AR have practical use (or meaningful adoption, since those aren't guaranteed to go hand-in-hand) in industry?

If we go to the website of PTC, the company that makes Vuforia, we can see that they have a lot of webpages talking about how many companies use them or have used them. But are these successful use cases? Like, The LEGO Group has used them before, for a few games and for those in-store displays where you hold up a box in front of a camera and the screen shows a digital version of the set that you can move around by moving the box. But since all of those are no longer in use, it seems hard to discern whether those were successful experiments. Similarly, IKEA used AR (but not Vuforia afaik) for their "IKEA Place" app and it seems that app is dead now.

But the LEGO ones were largely entertainment, and the others are for advertising, so in both cases very consumer-oriented. I've long been of the opinion that AR is a much better fit for things like manufacturing, repair work, and other more "practical" applications. Does this hold true?

So the question is, are the examples listed on PTC's website long-lasting and successful ventures or just things they tried briefly and abandoned?

Here is [a separate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZg7b1uP3ck) from October 2024 where they are talking about it as if it was successful and they are still using AR.

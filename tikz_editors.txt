Dia (Gnome)
	Sample output, as seen at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/161251/text-positions-in-imported-dia-flow-charts,
	seems very "raw" and difficult to edit. E.g., no "rectangle" or "diamond" nodes for creating the node outlines,
	from what I can tell, and instead hardcoding coordinates?

Inkscape?
	Requires unofficial extension.

Tikzmaker	(reddit,
	Web only, pictures!, shapes, labels, grid/snap for rect but not really for circles.
Tikzit		(reddit, gh-a, gh-1.2k
	Install only, very similar looking to Tikzmaker but no pictures
tikzcd		(reddit, gh-2k
	Web and install, Grid only, no shapes, fewer label options
quiver		(reddit, gh-a, 
	Web, similar to tikzcd but more options for arrows/labels (just not nodes)
freetikz	(ste3
	Converts hand-drawn diagram to string diagram
tikzedt		(ste0-4, gh-23)
	Seems like it has a fair bit of features but has few stars and hasn't been maintained in ages
qtikz/ktikz	(ste0-3, gh-386
	No dragging: just a fast live preview...
Flowframtk	(ste1
	Very few stars/mentions
Ipe editor	(gh-237, ste2
	No longer maintained (since 2015) but looks fairly capable?
		EXCEPT the GitHub shows activity quite recently? Not sure why I wrote the previous comment...
LaTeXDraw	(ste2-3
	Generates PSTricks (not tikz). Java. Last maintained 2020

# Non-Editor Alternatives

The following aren't editors but *might* make *some* tasks easier?

Asymptote
	Not tikz, but still a LaTeX thing, and might be better for 3D graphics. Feels more like programming; syntax less alien than tikz's.

PSTricks
	Seems there might be issues using it at the same as tikz (though there's a workaround).
	Not sure there are huge benefits that make it worth considering PSTricks if I already *sorta* know tikz.

MetaPost
	Another non-tikz LaTeX option.

# Bibliographies
From the answers to the TEX StackExchange post "[bibtex vs. biber and biblatex vs. natbib](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib)", it seems like the biblatex+biber combination is the most "modern" and would support the most new formats (e.g., web documents/articles/etc.) best.

Examples on how to use the two together can be found on Overleaf.com's "[Bibliography management with biblatex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex)" page.

For getting biblatex+biber to work in Texmaker, one needs to, as described in the answers to the TEX StackExchange post "[Biblatex + Biber + Texmaker + MiKTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44040/biblatex-biber-texmaker-miktex)", go into "Configure Texmaker" and, in the "Bibtex" field, replace "bibtex %" with "biber %" (the fact that we're putting "biber" in a field for "bibtex" is fine).
